Welcome to my Fruit Grabber

I am very new to coding and game development in general. This is my first attempt at learning so it takes
about a day to do some simple stuff. 

This game is just grab fruit and run up your score. 3 fruit types; regular +1 point, alternate +2 points, and
golden, which double your score for 20 seconds*(still figuring that one out). There is a pause menu*, but you
will not be allowed to exit the game screen without the game closing and totaling your score there*, kind of a
rogue-like fruit collecting thing. A leaderboard will show who has devoted there time to the score and idk, 
bragging rights?
