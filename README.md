Welcome to my Fruit Grabber

I am very new to coding and game development in general. This is my first attempt at learning so it takes
about a day to do some simple stuff. 

This game is just grab fruit and run up your score. 3 fruit types; regular +1 point, alternate +2 points, and
golden, which double your score for 20 seconds. There is a pause menu, but you will not be allowed to exit the 
game screen without the game closing and totaling your score there*, kind of a rogue-like fruit collecting 
thing. A leaderboard will show who has devoted there time to the score and idk, bragging rights?

At the moment I need help with saving the score when I pause the game, and using that data to create a leaderboard.
I want to have the score and time played on each playthrough.
